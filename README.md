http://mohammadmahoor.com/affectnet/

and must be pasted in `fer2013` and `affectNet` folders respectively.


You can download models from:

and paste them into the `checkpoint` folder

In this project, we compare the performance of four deep learning models - our own CNN model, VGG-16, ResNet-50, and DenseNet-121 - on the FER-2013 dataset for facial emotion recognition. This research provides insights for future work in the area of facial emotion recognition and can be useful in developing more accurate and efficient models.
